That witty comedian whose Instagram reels are pure gold? They're almost certainly a power player. For this Sunday's lunch inspiration, remember that beautifully filmed, bite-sized recipe video you saved on Instagram? Most likely, it was also shot by an influencer."

Because a successful influencer is defined by the number of people who follow them, it's safe to assume that without a business account, you'll be limited in terms of how much you can expand and how many people's feeds you can reach. A business account grants you access to Instagram's developed analytics tool, which provides us with comprehensive data and information on our followers. Instagram Insights lets users monitor key performance indicators in one place, from when the followers are most active to where they are from."

On the other hand, While we're on the subject of engagement, you should make an effort to interact with your Instagram users. Because Instagram is a social media platform, the emphasis should be on being sociable. Participate by liking other people's posts. And don't forget to add intelligent comments on why you liked the article. However, don't make the mistake of posting half-hearted responses and remarks. Bot engagement is shown by one word and one emoji comments. And rather than encouraging users to discover more about your account, this can drive them away. So interact with your fans, but do so in a way that is both relevant and intelligent."
